Income Statement (P & L) - Over Time - Sales Growth, Performance
Cash Flow statement - Over Time - Sources & uses of Cash, Liquidity
Balance Sheet - Point in Time - Assets & Liability, Investment

All the above 3 statements are a communication tool to share the current state of a company


Income Statement (Reflects accounting for sales & cost to generate those sales)
=====================================================================================
Sales - Expenses = Profit
Note: Expenses should match the sales of the period


Balance Sheet
===============================================================
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholer equity


Cash Flow Statement
============================================
The most difficult part of the cash flow statement is the cash flow from operations section. 
Naturally, that is where weâ€™ll find the source of the discrepancy between cash flow and profits.
