How do we make sound decisions within the company?
How do we evaluate a project and / or company?
How do we communicate the business results of our company?

Cash Flow Modeling
====================
- Use only incremental cash flows
- state assumptions clearly
- allow for the model to adjust to diffscenarios
- look at the bigger picture, what do the numbers mean?

Cost of Capital = minimum return expected to take on the business expedition
Cost of Capital = Risk free rate + Risk premium

Leverage NPV tool to find net value of the project at today's date.
